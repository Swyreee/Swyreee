# Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am Swyrin and I am a student now living in HCMC, Viet Nam.

I mainly code at C#, but sometimes I use JS, Python, C++ in according to the project requirements.


# Sometimes not programming :D
Beside being a programmer, I play games too. I mostly online on Discord (Swyrin#0727) so if you want to hit me up for games, feel free to DM me.
Below is a list of game that I play, add me if you want:
- Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege - GrenadeMagnet
- Arknights - Swyrin#7301
- [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13101472)


# Things I am working on
- [Lilia](https://github.com/Swyreee/Lilia): Maybe a good Discord bot, also my attempt at learning C# and learning how to *properly* use Git

# To-do
- ~~A trip to every place of Viet Nam~~
