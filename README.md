# Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am Swyrin and I am a student now living in HCMC, Viet Nam.

I mainly code at C#, but sometimes I use JS, Python, C(++) in according to the project.
I do coding whenever I am free and now I am doing my first own project - the gacha Discord bot (GH repo soonâ„¢)

I sometimes play games too, my favorite games are Rainbow Six Siege, Guardian Tales, Arknights. (This is a lie, I play games literally 80% of my free time.)

# Things I am working on
1. [Nekos.Net](https://github.com/Nekos-life/Nekos.Net): A C# library for interacting with _cute nekos_
2. [Nalia](https://github.com/Swyreee/Nalia): Just a discord bot.
3. My own optimizations for [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) for my own "stuffs"

# To-do
- [ ] A trip to every place of Viet Nam
