# Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am Swyrin and I am a student living in HCMC, Viet Nam. I mainly code at C# because I love its static typings and LINQ, but sometimes I use JS, Python, C++ according to my mood.

I once had an GitHub account named [swyrin](https://github.com/swyrin) but I forgot the password for it. Too bad, right?

# Sometimes a gamer
Beside being a programmer, I play games too. I mostly online on Discord (Swyrin#7193) so if you want to hit me up for games, feel free to DM me.
Below is a list of some games that I play, add me if you want:
- Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege - GrenadeMagnet
- Arknights - Swyrin#7301
- osu! - [Swyrin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/13101472)

# Projects I am "actively" working on
- [`Lilia`](https://github.com/Swyreee/Lilia) - A Discord bot made with convenient and very bad code in mind.
- [`arknights-gacha`](https://github.com/Swyreee/arknights-gacha) - A command line tool for simulating Arknights gacha.

# TODON'Ts
